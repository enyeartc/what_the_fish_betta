# Goals


# Logistic Regression
Attempt a Logistic Regression using 33x33px greyscaled images (1089 features)


## Image Processing

Greyscaled Using PIL's 'L' Algorithm
L = R * 299/1000 + G * 587/1000 + B * 114/1000

Resized with PIL's Nearest Neighbor

## Logistic Regression Background

Graphic of ideal mean and standard deviation for features. 
One graphic of a random feature showing overlap of mean and standard deviation.
This is going to go horribly.

## Initial Result

ROC Curve

## Apply Mask and New Result

## Conclusion

### Bonus -  Nearest Neighbor compilation of the 3 "most likely" fish



# Neural Net
